# MyAlphabetPuzzle
Android app I started for my son. It was suppose to be for me as the parent to enter words that he knows. then it was use that list to create a screen with a scrambled word. Then he would have to drag the letters back into place. It was suppose to be a nice game for toddlers to learn words and to read. Unfortunatly half was through I found it there was something like this already on the market so I stopped midway.
